==================
networking-midonet
==================

This is the official Midonet Neutron plugin.

The current set of supported versions of MidoNet are:

- v2015.06
- v5.x

NOTE: MidoNet recently changed its versioning scheme.
v5.0 is what used to be called v2015.09.


How to Install
--------------

For productional deployments, we recommend to use a package for your
distribution if available::

    http://builds.midonet.org/

You can install the plugin from the source code by running the following
command::

    $ sudo python setup.py install

The plugin requires python-midonetclient package, which is usually available
along with other midonet packages.  It's recommended to use the same version
of python-midonetclient and midonet-cluster.  Alternatively, you can install
python-midonetclient from source::

    $ sudo pip install -e 'git://github.com/midonet/midonet.git@master#egg=midonetclient&subdirectory=python-midonetclient'


Core plugin and L3 service plugin
---------------------------------

The following entry in ``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`` enables MidoNet as the Neutron plugin.
There are two plugins to choose from.

Plugin v1, which is compatible with MidoNet v2015.06::

    [DEFAULT]
    core_plugin = midonet

Plugin v2, which is compatible with MidoNet v5.0 and beyond.
It works with a separate L3 plugin which you need to add to the list of
service plugins::

    [DEFAULT]
    core_plugin = midonet_v2
    service_plugins = midonet_l3


ML2 mechanism and type drivers
------------------------------

Experimental ML2 mechanism driver and type drivers are available.
They are compatible with MidoNet v5.0 and beyond::

    [DEFAULT]
    core_plugin = ml2
    service_plugins = midonet_l3

    [ml2]
    tenant_network_types = midonet
    type_drivers = midonet,uplink
    mechanism_drivers = midonet


Interaction with Neutron agents
-------------------------------

For v2015.06, OpenStack deployment with MidoNet works with
Neutron DHCP and Metadata agents.

For MidoNet v5.0 and later, no Neutron agents are necessary.

For details, please refer to MidoNet documentation::

    https://docs.midonet.org


.. _interface-driver:

Interface driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Neutron agents use `interface driver` to connect themselves into the datapath.
In case of MidoNet, they should be configured with the MidoNet interface
driver.::

    [DEFAULT]
    interface_driver = midonet


LBaaS
-----

To enable LBaaS, enable the service plugin in ``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf``::

    [DEFAULT]
    service_plugins = lbaas

In addition to that, configure service providers as described in
the following sections.


MidoNet native provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in Kilo, MidoNet implements LBaaS v1 following the advanced
service driver model.  To configure MidoNet as the LBaaS provider, set the
following entries in the Neutron configuration file
``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf``::

    [service_providers]
    service_provider = LOADBALANCER:Midonet:midonet.neutron.services.loadbalancer.driver.MidonetLoadbalancerDriver:default

NOTE: This provider does not use Neutron LBaaS agent.


.. _lbaas-haproxy-provider:

Haproxy provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With MidoNet v5.2, you can use "haproxy" LBaaS provider (and possibly
other agent-based providers) with the following configuration in
``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf``::

    [service_providers]
    service_provider = LOADBALANCER:Haproxy:neutron_lbaas.services.loadbalancer.drivers.haproxy.plugin_driver.HaproxyOnHostPluginDriver:default

NOTE: This provider requires Neutron LBaaS agent.
The agent configuration, typically
``/etc/neutron/services/loadbalancer/haproxy/lbaas_agent.ini``,
needs to be configured as documented in :ref:`Interface driver <interface-driver>`.


Multiple providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure multiple providers as the following::

    [service_providers]
    service_provider = LOADBALANCER:Midonet:midonet.neutron.services.loadbalancer.driver.MidonetLoadbalancerDriver:default
    service_provider = LOADBALANCER:Haproxy:neutron_lbaas.services.loadbalancer.drivers.haproxy.plugin_driver.HaproxyOnHostPluginDriver

NOTE: With this example, you need to run Neutron LBaaS agent for
Haproxy provider.  See :ref:`Haproxy provider <lbaas-haproxy-provider>`
for its configuration.
Having the agent running doesn't affect MidoNet provider.


FWaaS
-----

Starting v5.0, MidoNet implements Neutron FWaaS extention API.

To configure it, add the following service plugin to the `service_plugins` list
in the DEFAULT section of ``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf``::

    [DEFAULT]
    service_plugins = midonet_firewall

NOTE: No need to configure `Firewall Driver` at all.  It's irrelevant
because this plugin does not use Neutron L3 agent.


VPNaaS
------

Starting v5.1, MidoNet implements Neutron VPNaaS extension API.

MidoNet plugin implements VPNaaS as a service driver.  To configure it,
add the following entries in the Neutron configuration file
``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf``::

    [DEFAULT]
    service_plugins = vpnaas

    [service_providers]
    service_provider=VPN:Midonet:midonet.neutron.services.vpn.service_drivers.midonet_ipsec.MidonetIPsecVPNDriver:default

NOTE: This plugin does not use Neutron VPNaaS agent.


Gateway Device Service
----------------------

Starting v5.1, MidoNet implements Gateway Device Service vendor extension API.

To configure it, add the following service plugin to the `service_plugins` list
in the DEFAULT section of `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`::

    [DEFAULT]
    service_plugins = midonet_gwdevice


L2 Gateway Service
------------------

Starting v5.1, MidoNet implements Neutron L2 Gateway Service extension API.
The implementation differs slightly from upstream.
Please check the following spec to see the differences:

    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/networking-midonet/specs/mitaka/border_gw.html

MidoNet plugin implements L2 Gateway Service as a service driver.
To configure it, add the following service plugin to the `service_plugins` list
in the DEFAULT section of `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`::

    [DEFAULT]
    service_plugins = midonet_l2gw

In addition, configure the service provider in the 'service_providers' section of
L2 Gateway plugin configuration file `/etc/neutron/l2gw_plugin.ini`::

    [service_providers]
    service_provider = L2GW:Midonet:midonet.neutron.services.l2gateway.service_drivers.l2gw_midonet.MidonetL2gwDriver:default


Magnum
------

Starting v5.2, MidoNet can be used for Magnum deployment with the
following workaround.

Currently MidoNet native loadbalancer doesn't meet the expectation
of Magnum in some ways.  You can workaround it by using "haproxy" provider
instead.  See :ref:`Haproxy provider <lbaas-haproxy-provider>` for
how to configure it.


BGP dynamic routing service
---------------------------

Starting v5.2, MidoNet implements Neutron BGP dynamic routing service extension API.
The implementation differs from upstream as follows:

- Router that is treated as bgp-speaker can be specified explicitly.
- Bgp-peer can relate to only one bgp-speaker.
- Binding network to bgp-speaker must be done before associating peers.
- Removing network from bgp-speaker must be done after all peers are
  disassociated from the bgp-speaker.
- Only one network can be associated with a bgp-speaker.
- Advertise_floating_ip_host_routes and advertise_tenant_networks are ignored.
- Attached network to the router and destination network in extra routes on the
  router are showed as advertised routes.

To configure it, add the following service plugin to the `service_plugins` list
in the DEFAULT section of `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`::

    [DEFAULT]
    service_plugins = midonet_bgp


Logging Resource Service
------------------------

Starting v5.2, MidoNet implements Neutron Logging Resource Service extension API.

To configure it, add the following service plugin to the `service_plugins` list
in the DEFAULT section of `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`::

    [DEFAULT]
    service_plugins = midonet_logging_resource

Firewall log is managed by Quota.
Default value of firewall log is 10 that is same number as firewall.
Basically, both Quota value for firewall and firewall log should be aligned.
To tune it, change value of `quota_firewall_log` in the quotas section of
`/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`.


Tap-as-a-Service
----------------

Starting v5.2, MidoNet implements Tap-as-a-Service extension API.

MidoNet plugin implements TaaS as a service driver.  To configure it,
add the following entries in the Neutron configuration file
`/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`::

    [DEFAULT]
    service_plugins = taas

In addition, configure the service provider in the 'service_providers' section of
TaaS plugin configuration file `/etc/neutron/taas_plugin.ini`::

    [service_providers]
    service_provider = TAAS:Midonet:midonet.neutron.services.taas.service_drivers.taas_midonet.MidonetTaasDriver:default


QoS
---

With the latest development version of MidoNet,
ML2 plugin with MidoNet mechansim driver supports Neutron QoS extension.

Note: MidoNet monolithic plugins (either v1 or v2) do not support QoS
extension.

QoS service plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QoS service plugin can be configured in the Neutron server configuration
file `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`::

    [DEFAULT]
    service_plugins = qos

    [qos]
    notification_drivers = midonet

QoS core resource extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QoS core resource extension for ML2 plugin can be configured in the
Neutron server configuration file `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`::

    [ml2]
    extension_drivers = qos


Horizon
-------

Starting with Newton, Horizon has built-in support for MidoNet network types.

To enable it, add the following configuration to the
`OPENSTACK_NEUTRON_NETWORK` dict in `local_settings.py`::

    'supported_provider_types': ['midonet', 'uplink'],
