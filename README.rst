This is the official Midonet Neutron plugin.

Supported MidoNet versions are:

- v2015.03
- v2015.06
- v5.0

NOTE: MidoNet recently changed its versioning scheme.
v5.0 is what used to be called v2015.09.


How to Install
--------------

For productional deployments, we recommend to use a package for your
distribution if available::

    http://repo.midonet.org/

You can install the plugin from the source code by running the following
command::

    $ sudo python setup.py install


Core plugin and L3 service plugin
---------------------------------

The following entry in ``neutron.conf`` enables MidoNet as the Neutron plugin.
There are two plugins to choose from.

Plugin v1, which is compatible with MidoNet v2015.03 and v2015.06::

    [DEFAULT]
    core_plugin = midonet.neutron.plugin_v1.MidonetPluginV2

Plugin v2, which is compatible with MidoNet v5.0 and beyond.
It works with a separate L3 plugin which you need to add to the list of
service plugins::

    [DEFAULT]
    core_plugin = midonet.neutron.plugin_v2.MidonetPluginV2
    service_plugins = midonet.neutron.services.l3.l3_midonet.MidonetL3ServicePlugin


LBaaS
-----

Starting in Kilo, MidoNet plugin implements LBaaS v1 following the advanced
service driver model.  To configure MidoNet as the LBaaS driver, set the
following entries in the Neutron configuration file
``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf``::

    [DEFAULT]
    service_plugins = lbaas

    [service_providers]
    service_provider=LOADBALANCER:Midonet:midonet.neutron.services.loadbalancer.driver.MidonetLoadbalancerDriver:default


Tests
-----

You can run the unit tests with the following command::

    $ ./run_tests.sh -f -V

``run_tests.sh`` installs its requirements to ``.venv`` on the initial run.
``-f`` forces a clean re-build of the virtual environment. If you just make
changes on the working tree without any change on the dependencies, you can
ignore ``-f`` switch.

``-V`` or ``--virtual-env`` is specified to use virtualenv and this should be
always turned on.


To know more detail about command options, please execute it with ``--help``::

    $ ./run_tests.sh --help
