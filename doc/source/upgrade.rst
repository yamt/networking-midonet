Upgrade Notes
=============

This section describes changes which might impact upgrades from the previous
releases.

--------------------
From Kilo to Liberty
--------------------

- A separate plugin ("v2 plugin") which is compatible with MidoNet v2015.09
  was introduced::

      core_plugin = midonet_v2
      service_plugins = midonet_l3

- Plugin entry point for v1 plugin (the older plugin which is compatible with
  MidoNet v2015.03 and v2015.06) has been moved out of Neutron tree:

  Before::

      core_plugin = midonet

  After::

      core_plugin = midonet_v2

- `midonet-db-manage` command is not obsolete.
  While it's still provided for backward compatibility, we plan to remove
  it in a feature release.
  You can use `neutron-db-manage --subproject networking-midonet` instead.

  For example,::

      neutron-db-manage --subproject networking-midonet upgrade head
