        ==================

        This is the official Midonet Neutron plugin.


        How to Install
        --------------

        Run the following command to install the plugin in the system:

        ::

            $ sudo python setup.py install

        The following entry in ``neutron.conf`` enables MidoNet as the Neutron plugin:

        ::
            core_plugin = neutron.plugins.midonet.plugin.MidonetPluginV2


        The Kilo MidoNet plugin is not compatible with MidoNet prior to 2.0.  Please
        use the Juno plugin if you want to use it against MidoNet version 1.X.


        Tests
        -----

        You can run the unit tests with the following command.::

            $ ./run_tests.sh -f -V

        ``run_tests.sh`` installs its requirements to ``.venv`` on the initial run.
        ``-f`` forces a clean re-build of the virtual environment. If you just make
        changes on the working tree without any change on the dependencies, you can
        ignore ``-f`` switch.

        ``-V`` or ``--virtual-env`` is specified to use virtualenv and this should be
        always turned on.


        To know more detail about command options, please execute it with ``---help``.::

            $ ./run_tests.sh --help


        Creating Packages
        -----------------

        Run the following command to generate both both the RPM and Debian packages
        with the provided version:
        ::

            $ ./package.sh some_version
